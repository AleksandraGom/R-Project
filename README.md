# Analysis of the expression of ephrin proteins and their receptors
Recent studies indicate the role of ephrin proteins and their receptors in the processes affecting the progression of melanoma. Overexpression of genes encoding Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands is often found in neoplastic diseases, including melanomas. However, there are no reports on the expression of these proteins in normal tissue, such as skin or nevus, in relation to primary melanoma that is not in the metastatic stage.

The aim of this study was to verify whether the expression of ephrin receptors differs between healthy skin, benign nevus and primary melanoma. It was made on the basis of statistical analysis of data from microarrays available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database record - GDS1375 and their visualization using the R programming language.

An analysis of the expression of 8 ephrins: efna1, efna2, efna3, efna4, efna5, efnb1, efnb2, efnb3 and 11 ephrin receptors: epha1, epha2, epha3, epha4, epha5, epha7, ephb1, ephb2, ephb3, ephb4, ephb6 was performed. The analysis was carried on 70 samples corresponding to three types of disease states: 45 primary melanomas, 18 benign nevi and 7 normal skin tissues.
